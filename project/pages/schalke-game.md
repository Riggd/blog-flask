### FC Schalke 04 vs TSG 1899 Hoffenheim

Spending money is something we all loathe, yet also something we do every day. Alright... Spending 
a few dollars here and there isn't that bad either, but shortly after I arrived in Germany for my 
six month internship I had two opportunities arise. First off, getting to visit a friend of mine 
who studied for six months at Ball State University with me, and secondly getting a chance to stand 
in the home team fan section of my favourite soccer team, **FC Schalke 04**. Of course that is an
opportunity I would not dare pass up. 

Having followed FC Schalke 04 since I was roughly 12 years old, I was delighted to find out my friend 
could get the tickets, and at that, for only 20<i class="fa fa-euro"></i>. The decision was made I was
 travelling to Goslar, a small city near Hanover, to visit my friend and go see this game in the 
 Veltins Arena. Travelling in Germany is something I assumed would be relatively cheap; however, 
 my weekend ticket to Goslar and back to Radolfzell cost me a whopping 170<i class="fa fa-euro"></i>, 
 or $230 for those reading from the States. To hell with it, I booked the ticket. Keep in mind while 
 working a full-time internship this meant, leave Friday after work at 5:30pm followed by sitting in
 a train for 12 hours until I finally reach Goslar the next morning at 6 or 7 in the morning. 

7:00am on Saturday, March 8th, I made it to Goslar. Now only hours left till we made our 2.5 hour drive 
to the stadium. First as all good Germans do, my friend and I visited the bakery and picked up some 
rolls for our journey. A few hours later a few more joined our group making us a group of 5, everyone 
wearing their FC Schalke 04 jerseys hoping for a victory. We made a short pit-stop at the grocery store 
to pick up a much needed case of Schalke's Arena beer, Veltin's. Finally we were on our way!

A few FC Schalke 04 fan songs later and we had made it, Veltin's Arena. It was hard for me to hold back
my excitement, and I am almost sure I had a goofy grin on my face. But hey a man at his favourite 
team's stadium for the first time in his life, who would run around with a stupid grin?
